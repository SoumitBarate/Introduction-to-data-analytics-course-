## 🔄 Key Terminologies in Data Analytics

- **Observation**: A single instance or record in a dataset (e.g., one row in a table).
- **Data Sampling**: The process of selecting a subset of data from a larger dataset to perform analysis.
- **Dataset**: A structured collection of data, usually organized in rows and columns.
- **Prediction**: Estimating unknown outcomes based on known data using statistical or machine learning models.

## 📊 Types of Data

### 1. **Structured Data**
- Data that is processed, stored, and retrieved in a fixed format (e.g., relational databases, spreadsheets).
- Examples: SQL tables, Excel files.

### 2. **Semi-Structured Data**
- Contains both structured and unstructured elements.
- Examples: JSON, XML files.

### 3. **Unstructured Data**
- Data that lacks a specific form or structure.
- Examples: Emails, images, videos, social media content.

## 📐 Data Levels of Measurement

1. **Nominal**:
   - Categorical data without order.
   - Example: Types of fruits, gender.

2. **Ordinal**:
   - Categorical data with a meaningful order but unknown intervals.
   - Example: Rankings (1st, 2nd, 3rd), satisfaction level.

3. **Interval**:
   - Numeric data with ordered categories and equal spacing, but no true zero.
   - Example: Temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit.

4. **Ratio**:
   - Numeric data with ordered categories, equal spacing, and a true zero.
   - Example: Height, weight, income.
